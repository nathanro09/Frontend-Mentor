### Review

Aside from some styling elements that weren't provided, I think I created a near identical copy, aside from the box-shadow. This challenge was an overall good review for HTML and CSS. I think my biggest blockers for this exercise was my habitual desire to create a react functional component and the positioning of the overlay.
